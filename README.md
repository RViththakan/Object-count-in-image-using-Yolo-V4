# Object-count-in-image-using-Yolo-V4

Welcome to the Object Count in Image using YOLOv4 repository! This project focuses on counting objects in images using the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) object detection algorithm.

**About**

In this repository, you will find:

Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for object detection and counting using YOLOv4.
Pre-trained YOLOv4 models for detecting various objects in images.
Datasets containing images with annotations for training and testing the object detection model.
Documentation and resources related to the project.

**Object Detection with YOLOv4**

YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. In this project, we utilize YOLOv4 to detect objects in images and count their occurrences.

**Usage**

You can utilize this project for:

Counting the number of specific objects (e.g., cars, pedestrians, animals) in images.
Analyzing object distribution and density in different scenes or environments.
Implementing object counting functionality in your own applications or systems.

**How to Use**

To get started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Explore the scripts and notebooks provided for object detection and counting.
Download pre-trained YOLOv4 models or train your own models using the provided datasets.
Run the scripts or notebooks to perform object counting on your images.

**Contributions**

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, additional features, or better models, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
